# Color Guessing Game

An interactive browser-based guessing game where players try to identify a randomly selected color from a predefined set. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Color Guessing Game challenges players to guess a randomly selected color from a set of 10 available colors. The game provides intelligent feedback based on alphabetical ordering and includes a visual flowchart demonstrating the game logic.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Random Color Selection**: Game randomly picks from 10 predefined colors
- **Interactive Guessing**: Players enter guesses via browser prompts
- **Smart Feedback System**: Hints based on alphabetical ordering
- **Visual Reward**: Background changes to the correct color upon winning
- **Attempt Tracking**: Counts and displays number of guesses made

### Available Colors
The game includes 10 colors: `blue`, `cyan`, `gold`, `gray`, `green`, `magenta`, `orange`, `red`, `white`, `yellow`

### Feedback System
- **Alphabetically Higher**: "Your guess is alphabetically higher than what I'm thinking"
- **Alphabetically Lower**: "Your guess is alphabetically lower than what I'm thinking"
- **Invalid Color**: "I don't recognize your color"
- **Success**: Congratulations message with attempt count

## Technical Implementation
